    "In this mandatory exercise you are going to implement a multivariate Gaussian classifier and use it to classifiy images with 4 different texture classes. You must implement your own classifier, but you are allowed to use library functions to invert matrixes, compute the determinant, and compute the mean vector and the covariance matrix for each class. It is recommended that you use an environment where you have access to a numerically stable library function for matrix inversion (for example Matlab).\n",

    "### Submission through notebook\n",
    "If you submit using a Jupyter notebook, you notebook MUST contain discussion of the required aspect, figures, code, and discussion of what the figures show. Create a zip-file of all materials and check that it displays correctly if downloaded from a differnet directory.  The format of the text should be like what you find in a techinical report.\n",

    "• Deadline for Part II:  Monday November 9, 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission:\n",
    "Your solution should be submitted as a single PDF file contraining the problem descrition, discussion, and supporting source code. The files should be compressed (.zip or .tar) in a folder names YOURUSERNAME_PARTII.zip/tar and upload it through the devilry system (devilry.ifi.uio.no) before the deadline above. Questions about the submission can be directed to the group teacher.\n",

    "Since image processing is a field where solutions often are found by experimenting\n",
    "with different methods, we would like to emphasize the following point: You will be\n",
    "credited for analyzing the problem and the input images so you can select suitable\n",
    "methods and features. You will not be credited for testing all available\n",
    "methods/features, even if it is a huge amount of work. Analysis and discussion, of\n",
    "both input and output, are very important. Please note that both mandatory exercises must be passed in order to take the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to work\n",
    "The exercise is an individual work, and each student should deliver a written report. Your report should be genuine, in particular we will check that each report provides its own discussion of all method and parameter choices. Include references if you use external sources.\n",
    "The report should contain the description of the problem, theory, chosen methods, results and algorithms used. You have to document all steps in the algorithms, and listings of our own code should be included as appendix. The code for your classification algorithm should be listed in your report.\n",
